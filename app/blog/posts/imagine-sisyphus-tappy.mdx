* The B2B SaaS Game Jam

I am visiting the tech heart of NYC in the month of vibetober. The foliage is starting to fade - the atmosphere begins to get spooky and sit on the eve of local upstart "Zohran Mamdani" and his revolution. Meanwhile, I joined a handful of people who come together to stage a week-long intensive "B2B SaaS Jam".

A B2B SaaS Jam is like a regular game jam, except some people choose to make video games. Curiously, nobody here made B2B SaaS, though we had two B2C softwares.

I joined a group intent on making a rhythm game featuring Sisyphus of lore.

** How did I feel throughout the process?

One of the challenges I have is knowing that I have much to improve on, while also having come so far already. And I know that many others are in the same boat.

It is sad for me to hear people bring themselves down so much.
But that night, I was talking about objectively, our game is kind of crappy? But that doesn't detract from the really amazing experience. But that I was also super proud of our team.

Scratch that -- I was falling into the trap that the only thing we "made" was the game - a product oriented perspective. The more important thing is that we have teamwork.


And we got player feedback. That was an amazing feeling.
For a long time, I've learned a lot about many different programming paradigms up and down the programming stack, but never stopped to learn about web development.


It's a great feeling to be able to actually show people what we've worked on. 

* Quality in a team 

* The experience of writing code and reviewing code is very different and invokes different parts of ourselves.

When I was reviewing my own code for my frappe framework certfication project, I made a deliberate effort to review my own code from a fresh set of eyes, which made development very slow. I tried activating my mind powers to pretend that I was actually seeing things from another perspective, which helped, but it's not quite the same thing as reviewing other peoples' code.

As a reviewer, I had an impersonal, collective sense of responsibility in mind.
As a contributor, I easily made mistakes in clean coding principles.

* Web Dev is Pretty Decent

* Some kudos:
- I am so grateful for A's pursuit of grug brained development and keeping our scope in check. 
- N pulled through hard. She knew that she needed to push for her own vision, and our end product lined up with music video she'd always had in her head for /Garbage - Girl Don't Come/.
- R brought crucial emotional honesty to the team. This project taught me the meaning of being "the heart of the team", and I am incredibly grateful for that. In particular, 

I've commonly heard the other guests
There is no reason to be scared. But it's okay if you are.
